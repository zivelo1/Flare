# Flare — Project Status

## Current Phase: Phase 9 — UI Polish & Security (Android)
**Strategy:** Android-first. In target markets (Iran, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Myanmar, Cuba, Venezuela, Ethiopia), Android has 85-98% market share. iOS deferred to backlog.
**Previous:** Phase 8 localization (6 languages), Phase 6A device testing verified — encrypted BLE mesh messaging working on 2 physical Android devices.

## What's Done

### Rust Core (193 tests passing)
- [x] Identity generation (Ed25519 signing + X25519 key agreement)
- [x] Diffie-Hellman key agreement between devices
- [x] HKDF key derivation (per-message keys from shared secrets)
- [x] AES-256-GCM authenticated encryption/decryption
- [x] Message protocol (wire format, builder, serialization)
- [x] Spray-and-Wait mesh router with adaptive TTL
- [x] Bloom filter message deduplication
- [x] Peer table with RSSI-based distance estimation
- [x] BLE message chunking/reassembly for MTU constraints
- [x] SQLCipher encrypted database (identity, contacts, messages, outbox)
- [x] Transport event model and abstraction layer
- [x] UniFFI FFI layer (`FlareNode` object with proc macros, payload extraction, conversation query)
- [x] Neighborhood Bloom Filter — privacy-preserving cluster detection (deterministic SHA-256)
- [x] Priority Message Store — 50MB budget, 3-tier eviction, adaptive TTL (48h → 72h → 7d)
- [x] Delivery ACK processing — relay cleanup on ACK receipt
- [x] Bridge encounter detection — Jaccard similarity on neighborhood bitmaps
- [x] **Multi-hop relay** — `signable_bytes()` excludes `hop_count` + `ttl_seconds` (mutable by relay nodes), `prepare_for_relay()` increments hop count
- [x] **Content type generalization** — `build_mesh_message` accepts `content_type` parameter (Text, Voice, Image, KeyExchange, ACK, ReadReceipt, GroupMessage, ApkOffer, ApkRequest)
- [x] **Delivery receipts** — `create_delivery_ack()`, `create_read_receipt()`, `update_delivery_status()` FFI methods
- [x] **Group messaging (database layer)** — `groups` and `group_members` tables, CRUD operations, `build_group_messages()` FFI
- [x] **Duress PIN** — Argon2id-hashed duress passphrase stored in `duress_config` table, `check_duress_passphrase()` standalone function for pre-login check
- [x] **APK sharing protocol** — `ApkOfferPayload`, `ApkRequestPayload`, `ApkChunk` types, chunked transfer with SHA-256 verification, 16KB chunk size
- [x] **Adaptive power management** — `PowerManager` with 4-tier duty cycling (High/Balanced/LowPower/UltraLow), configurable thresholds, burst mode scanning, battery-aware tier transitions (12 tests)
- [x] **DEFLATE compression** — `compress_payload`/`decompress_payload` with 1-byte header, MIN_COMPRESS_SIZE=64, decompression bomb protection (8 tests)
- [x] **Ed25519 APK signing** — `DeveloperSigningKey`, `TrustedDeveloperKeys` store, `ApkSignature` verification, key rotation protocol with old-key endorsement (10 tests)

- [x] **Blind Rendezvous Protocol** — decentralized peer discovery without servers:
  - Shared Phrase mode: Argon2id(normalized_phrase, salt=epoch_week), ~50+ bits entropy, nation-state resistant
  - Phone Number mode: Bilateral hash = Argon2id(sort(phone_A, phone_B), salt=epoch_week), with explicit security warning
  - Contact Import mode: Pre-compute bilateral tokens for all phone contacts
  - Proof-of-work anti-spam: 16 leading zero bits in SHA256(token || nonce), ~50ms per token
  - Weekly epoch rotation: tokens rotate via `epoch_week = unix_timestamp / (7 * 86400)`
  - Ephemeral X25519 keypair per search for forward secrecy
  - Identity encryption in replies: X25519 ECDH → HKDF(shared_secret, salt=token) → AES-256-GCM (eavesdropper-resistant)
  - `RendezvousManager` with active search tracking, token registration, request/reply processing
  - 15 dedicated tests for rendezvous protocol
- [x] **Adaptive spray count** — spray copies = ceil(sqrt(observed_peers) × density_factor), clamped to [3, 16]. Based on Spyropoulos et al. optimal L = O(sqrt(N)). Reduces broadcast amplification in dense networks (7 tests)
- [x] **Neighborhood-aware routing** — bridge peers prioritized in spray target selection. `connected_peers_prioritized()` sorts by encounter type: Bridge > Unknown > Intermediate > Local. Reduces wasted hops by preferring cluster-crossing peers (4 tests)
- [x] **Message size tiers** — `SizeTierConfig` with Small (≤15KB, mesh relay), Medium (≤64KB, direct preferred), Large (>64KB, direct required). Content-type-aware: voice/images always prefer direct. 8 tests
- [x] **Wi-Fi Direct transfer queue** — `WifiDirectManager` with FIFO queue, 3-retry failure handling, 5-minute timeout, 50 max pending transfers, connection state tracking. 10 tests

## What's Next

### Phase 6A — Device Testing (Verified on 2 Physical Devices)
- [x] Cross-compile Rust core for Android ARM targets (`aarch64-linux-android`, `armv7-linux-androideabi`) — arm64: 7.6MB, armv7: 5.3MB
- [x] Debug APK builds successfully with both ABIs — **app-debug.apk**
- [x] Install and test on physical Android devices via adb
  - Phone 1: Samsung (RFCT804CZEP) — Android 14 (API 34), arm64-v8a
  - Phone 2: Samsung (R9HR105EYKJ) — Android 12 (API 31), armeabi-v7a
- [x] **Integration test: Encrypted chat over BLE mesh — WORKING**
  - QR code contact exchange between devices
  - End-to-end encrypted message send/receive over BLE GATT
  - Zero internet required — pure mesh networking
- [x] BLE GATT auto-connection — devices discover and connect automatically
- [x] BLE GATT MTU negotiation — 517 bytes requested, usable capped at 512 (Android 512-byte characteristic value limit)
- [x] **Voice message delivery over BLE mesh — WORKING** (both directions)
- [x] **Image message delivery over BLE mesh — WORKING** (both directions)
- [x] API backward compatibility — BLE GATT APIs work on both API 31 (deprecated path) and API 34 (new path)
- [ ] Wi-Fi Direct group formation on real hardware
- [ ] Power management tier behavior on real battery

#### Bugs Fixed During Device Testing
- **Missing GATT auto-connection:** BleScanner discovered peers but never initiated GATT connections. Added auto-connect flow in MeshService triggered by new peer discovery
- **Missing conversation creation:** `add_contact()` in Rust core only created contact row but not conversation row, causing FOREIGN KEY constraint failure when storing messages. Fixed in `ffi.rs` + `database.rs` with `ensure_conversation()`
- **API 31 BLE crash:** `writeDescriptor(descriptor, value)`, `writeCharacteristic(char, data, type)`, and `notifyCharacteristicChanged(device, char, confirm, data)` are API 33+. Added backward-compatible paths using deprecated APIs for older devices
- **Permission request loop:** `requestBluetoothPermissions()` called every `onResume` even when already granted, causing infinite dialog loop. Fixed to check permissions first and start MeshService directly if all granted
- **armv7 native library missing:** Second phone (armeabi-v7a) crashed with `library "libflare_core.so" not found`. Cross-compiled for armv7 target and included in APK
- **BLE chunk truncation (media messages):** Android silently caps BLE characteristic write/notify values at 512 bytes regardless of negotiated ATT_MTU (517). Code stored usable MTU as 514, causing 2 bytes of silent truncation per chunk. After multi-chunk reassembly, corrupted data failed bincode deserialization (DROP_PARSE_ERROR). Fixed: cap usable MTU at `min(ATT_MTU - 3, 512)`
- **Duplicate message sends:** `MeshService.startMesh()` called multiple times via `onStartCommand` (START_STICKY), creating duplicate coroutine collectors that sent every message 3-4x. Fixed: added re-entry guard
- **One-way GattClient connections:** Auto-connect skipped creating a GattClient connection if the peer was already connected to our GattServer, leaving one direction with only the unreliable notification path. Fixed: removed server-guard from auto-connect
- **Unreliable notification path for media:** GattServer NOTIFY path is fire-and-forget (no per-chunk ACK), causing silent data loss for multi-chunk messages. Fixed: prefer GattClient WRITE path (reliable Write Request/Response), de-duplicate sends
- **Parse error vs signature error conflation:** Rust `route_incoming` returned `DropInvalidSignature` for bincode parse failures, masking the real error. Fixed: added `DropParseError` variant to `FfiRouteDecision`
- **Delivery ACK decryption failure:** ContentType 5 (Acknowledgment) payloads are unencrypted message ID hashes, but `processIncomingMessage` attempted decryption. Fixed: skip decryption for ACK messages

### Phase 7 — Security Hardening (Complete)
- [x] **Full security code audit** — read all security-critical Rust files, identified 5 vulnerabilities
- [x] **CRITICAL FIX: Database key derivation** — `derive_key()` used random salt on every open, making DB unopenable on restart. Fixed: deterministic salt via SHA-256(domain_separator || passphrase). Added 2 regression tests (determinism + uniqueness)
- [x] **CRITICAL FIX: Hardware-backed key fallback** — Android Keystore hardware-backed path used guessable `Build.FINGERPRINT.hashCode()`. Fixed: encrypt a fixed challenge with the hardware key, store the ciphertext hash as passphrase (unforgeable without TEE access)
- [x] **HIGH FIX: Rendezvous reply eavesdropping** — reply encryption used HKDF(ephemeral_public_key) as input, but the ephemeral public key is broadcast in cleartext — any eavesdropper could decrypt. Fixed: proper X25519 ECDH between responder's ephemeral key and querier's ephemeral key, nonce derived from token + responder public key
- [x] **HIGH FIX: Payload length truncation** — `signable_bytes()` cast `payload.len()` to `u16`, truncating for payloads >65535 bytes. An attacker could append data without invalidating signatures. Fixed: cast to `u64`
- [x] **MEDIUM FIX: TTL extension factor ignored** — `compute_max_allowed_ttl()` returned hard-coded 7-day cap regardless of original TTL. `max_ttl_extension_factor` config was defined but never used. Fixed: infers original TTL from message age + current TTL, applies 3.5x factor, capped at 7-day absolute max
- [ ] Duress PIN forensic analysis (dual-database detectability)
- [ ] Traffic analysis resistance (BLE fingerprinting)
- [ ] Bloom filter privacy validation (initial review: 4-byte short_id + 6-hour rollover looks sound)

### Phase 8 — Localization & UX Improvements (Android) (Complete)
- [x] **Farsi/Persian** — Farsi string translations (values-fa)
- [x] **Arabic** — Arabic string translations (values-ar)
- [x] **Spanish** — string translations (values-es)
- [x] **Russian** — string translations (values-ru)
- [x] **Chinese (Simplified)** — string translations (values-zh-rCN)
- [x] **Korean** — string translations (values-ko)
- [x] **Language selector** — LanguageSettingsScreen with runtime locale switching via AppCompatDelegate
- [x] **All hardcoded strings extracted** — every UI string moved to strings.xml with positional format specifiers
- [x] **Contact rename** — long-press to rename contacts, backed by Rust DB `update_contact_display_name`
- [x] **Broadcast messaging** — BroadcastScreen for sending messages to all contacts with confirmation dialog
- [x] **Profile name** — editable display name in Settings, persisted via SharedPreferences
- [ ] RTL layout testing (Farsi/Arabic) — chat bubbles, navigation direction

### Phase 9 — UI Polish (Android) (Complete)
- [x] **Dark mode toggle** — user-selectable light/dark/system in Settings with AlertDialog and RadioButton options, activity recreate on change
- [x] **Version display** — BuildConfig.VERSION_NAME shown in Settings About section
- [x] **Language confirmation dialog** — OK/Cancel approval before switching language (prevents accidental changes)
- [x] **AppCompatActivity migration** — MainActivity uses AppCompatActivity for proper locale switching via AppCompatDelegate
- [x] **Voice recording permission fix** — permission check at composition time via ContextCompat.checkSelfPermission
- [x] **Voice message sending** — Base64-encoded audio (24kbps/16kHz, ~90KB max) over mesh with playback UI (MediaPlayer)
- [x] **Image message sending** — scaled (400px max) / compressed (JPEG q35) image, Base64-encoded (~130KB max), rendered in chat bubbles
- [x] **Contact deletion** — cascading delete (messages → conversations → contact) with confirmation dialog
- [x] **CI fix** — x86_64-linux-android OpenSSL cross-compilation (RANLIB env var)
- [x] **KeyExchange protocol** — QR scan auto-sends sender's public keys to scanned contact, enabling immediate two-way messaging without mutual QR scan
- [x] **APK sharing via system intent** — share app file via Nearby Share, Bluetooth, WhatsApp, etc. (replaced non-functional BLE transfer stubs)
- [x] **content_type in FfiMeshMessage** — Rust FFI now exposes message content type for routing KeyExchange, voice, image messages
- [x] **BLE chunking** — 5-byte header protocol (magic=0xF1, msgId, chunkIdx, totalChunks) for payloads exceeding BLE MTU (512 bytes, Android hard limit). Sequential GATT writes/notifications with onCharacteristicWrite/onNotificationSent callbacks. Per-address Mutex prevents interleaving. ChunkReassembler with 30s stale timeout pruning. Max 255 chunks (~130KB per message). Backward compatible with non-chunked data
- [x] **BLE send path reliability** — prefer GattClient WRITE path (reliable Write Request/Response with per-chunk ACK) over GattServer NOTIFY path (fire-and-forget). De-duplicate sends: each peer receives via write if available, notify only as fallback. Bidirectional GattClient connections ensured by removing server-guard from auto-connect
- [x] **MeshService re-entry guard** — prevent duplicate coroutine collectors when `onStartCommand` is called multiple times (START_STICKY), which caused messages to be sent 3-4x
- [x] **Acknowledgment message handling** — ContentType 5 (delivery ACK) now handled specially in processIncomingMessage, preventing decryption errors on unencrypted ACK payloads
- [x] **Destruction code (full implementation)** — replaces non-functional duress PIN skeleton. Two codes: unlock code (opens normally) + destruction code (permanently erases all data). Codes stored as SHA-256 hashes in SharedPreferences. Data wipe: stop MeshService → clear prefs → delete DB files → reset FlareRepository → reinitialize FlareNode with fresh identity
- [x] **Lock screen with biometric** — BiometricPrompt (fingerprint/face) as primary unlock, manual code entry as fallback. Shown on every app launch when destruction code is configured. Entering destruction code triggers full data wipe
- [x] **FlareApplication.wipeAndReinitialize()** — complete data destruction: stops mesh service, clears SharedPreferences, deletes encrypted database files (flare.db, -wal, -shm), resets FlareRepository singleton, reinitializes FlareNode with fresh identity
- [ ] **Emoji picker** — in-chat emoji selector for quick access beyond system keyboard

### Phase 10 — Android Release
- [ ] Battery drain profiling across power tiers
- [ ] Memory profiling under relay load
- [ ] Wi-Fi Direct testing on real hardware
- [ ] Power management tier behavior on real battery
- [ ] Signed release APK
- [ ] F-Droid submission
- [ ] First GitHub Release (tagged APK download)

### Future Enhancements (Backlog)
- [ ] **iOS device testing** — physical iPhone BLE, cross-platform Android↔iOS messaging (Rust iOS cross-compilation already verified)
- [ ] **iOS App Store submission** — $99/year Apple Developer Program, App Store review
- [ ] iOS localization (SwiftUI RTL, translations for all 6 languages)
- [ ] iOS background execution tuning (CoreBluetooth state restoration is wired but untested)

### Known Issues (Remaining)
- **FFI method gaps:** Several Kotlin methods in `FlareRepository.kt` called FFI methods that don't exist in the UniFFI bindings (`wifiDirect*`, `power*`, `recommendTransferStrategy`, `processRemoteNeighborhoodForPeer`). These are currently stubbed with local implementations. The Rust FFI layer needs to expose these methods properly.

### Known Issues (Resolved)
- **Coil dependency was missing:** `ImagePreviewSheet.kt` imports `coil` for async image loading but it wasn't in `build.gradle.kts`. **Fixed.**
- **`settings.gradle.kts` had `dependencyResolution` instead of `dependencyResolutionManagement`** — invalid Gradle API name. **Fixed.**
- **Gradle wrapper (`gradlew`)** was missing from the repo — generated during this phase. **Fixed.**
- **SQLCipher cross-compilation** required switching from `bundled-sqlcipher` to `bundled-sqlcipher-vendored-openssl` in Cargo.toml to bundle OpenSSL source for Android NDK builds. **Fixed.**
- **UniFFI metadata stripped** — `strip = true` in release profile removed UniFFI metadata from .so. Changed to `strip = "debuginfo"`. **Fixed.**
- **Crash on update from pre-v0.8:** Old `derive_key()` used random salt, making databases encrypted with an irrecoverable key. New deterministic salt produces a different key, so old DB can't be opened. **Fixed:** `FlareRepository.initialize()` catches the error, deletes the old DB, and creates a fresh one. One-time migration — all future updates preserve data.
- **One-way QR bug:** User A scans User B's QR and sends a message, but B cannot decrypt (B doesn't have A's keys). **Fixed:** KeyExchange protocol — scanning a QR automatically sends the scanner's public keys to the scanned contact via a KeyExchange mesh message (content_type=4). The receiver auto-adds the sender as an unverified contact.
- **Voice/image messages not received:** Media messages (voice, image) sent as file paths instead of encoded binary data. **Fixed:** Base64-encode media bytes, prefix with `flare:voice:` or `flare:image:`, send through text encryption pipeline. Receiver detects prefix and renders audio player or image.
- **Voice/image messages truncated on BLE:** Encoded media payloads (10-200KB) exceeded BLE MTU (~514 bytes) and were silently truncated by GATT. **Fixed:** BLE chunking protocol with 5-byte header, sequential writes with callback synchronization, and chunk reassembly on receive.
- **Duress PIN was non-functional skeleton:** Only stored Argon2id hash in Rust DB with no lock screen or data wipe. **Fixed:** Complete destruction code implementation with BiometricPrompt lock screen, SHA-256 code hashes in SharedPreferences, and full data wipe (delete DB, clear prefs, reinitialize).
- **CI x86_64 cross-compilation failure:** OpenSSL build failed with `x86_64-linux-android-ranlib: not found`. **Fixed:** Added `RANLIB_*` environment variable pointing to NDK's `llvm-ranlib` in GitHub Actions workflow.
- **APK sharing screens were stubs:** Share/receive screens had no backend integration (BLE advertising code was placeholder). **Fixed:** Replaced with functional Android system share intent (Nearby Share, Bluetooth, messaging apps) using FileProvider.
- **Voice/image messages exceed BLE chunk limit:** Encoded media payloads exceeded the 255-chunk BLE limit (~130KB). Voice at 128kbps/44.1kHz produced ~480KB for 30s; images at 800px/q60 could reach ~160KB. **Fixed:** Reduced image max dimension (800→400px) and JPEG quality (60→35%), lowered voice encoding bitrate (128→24kbps) and sample rate (44.1→16kHz), added 90KB size guard in FlareRepository, and fixed sender-side storage to persist full media content (Base64-encoded) instead of display text.
